The outline of the task is as follows:

- Only films from 2010 should be selected
- Movies should be the only title type
- Only the primary title should be used
- Remove the end date and isadult fields entirely

I aim for my project to consist of the original .csv file, a file of functions, an execution file and eventually the 
final transformed .csv file.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Use a further criterion of my own choice
- Explain the processes involved in ETL
- Error handling must be used throughout 

## ETL
